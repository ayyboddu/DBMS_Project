# DBMS_Project
Database Translation Project

## Project Overview

This project involves restructuring the dataset obtained from the GitHub Events API (https://api.github.com/events) to make it suitable for loading into a SQL or Graph database. We have opted to use a Graph database for this purpose and will be implementing the solution in Python. The primary reason for choosing Python is its availability of various libraries that facilitate working with graph databases, such as Py2neo for Neo4j and Graphene for ArangoDB.
